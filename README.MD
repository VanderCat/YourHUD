![A Hud](https://github.com/VanderCat/YourHUD/blob/main/img/HUD.jpg?raw=true)
## Description
A customizable ToonHUD-esque (TF2 Custom) HUD.
You can change position, size, font, colors, in-game.
Also i tried to match clip/ammo part to it's HL2 original state ([with a very very hard to understand code though](https://github.com/VanderCat/YourHUD/blob/main/lua/autorun/client/HUDmain.lua#L167))

I made this mod because i was in need a more "pro" hud i could not find myself.

## Features
- HUD guess how to render ammo/clip/alt counter
    - this works in 99% however there's some exceptions (like [SLAM](https://github.com/VanderCat/YourHUD/blob/main/img/GuessIssue.jpg?raw=true))
- Health change watcher ([IMG1](https://github.com/VanderCat/YourHUD/blob/main/img/hpRecover.jpg?raw=true) [IMG2](https://github.com/VanderCat/YourHUD/blob/main/img/hpLose.jpg?raw=true))
- Player list on top 
- you can enable and/or disable drawing of HL2's hud or YourHUD ([IMG1](https://github.com/VanderCat/YourHUD/blob/main/img/SettingsVisibility.jpg?raw=true))
- Fully customizable
    - [Position](https://github.com/VanderCat/YourHUD/blob/main/img/SettingsOffsets.jpg?raw=true)
    - [Size](https://github.com/VanderCat/YourHUD/blob/main/img/SettingsFonts.jpg?raw=true)
    - [Font](https://github.com/VanderCat/YourHUD/blob/main/img/SettingsFonts.jpg?raw=true)
    - [Colors](https://github.com/VanderCat/YourHUD/blob/main/img/SettingsColors.jpg?raw=true)

## Planned Features
- TF2-esque playername showcase
- Show player state (dead or alive) on mini scoreboard
- Change HUD elements align

# Broken
- To use coolvetica default font you need to download and install it in system (bcs it's not free üòí)
    - You can just alter font in settings though
    - or [download](https://dl.dafont.com/dl/?f=coolvetica) it and install (Coolvetica RG)
