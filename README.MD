![With Ammo](https://github.com/VanderCat/YourHUD/blob/main/img/YesAmmo.jpg?raw=true)
## Description
A customizable ToonHUD-esque (TF2 Custom) HUD.
You can change position, size, font, colors, in-game.
Also i tried to match clip/ammo part to it's HL2 original state ([with a very very hard to understand code though](https://github.com/VanderCat/YourHUD/blob/main/lua/autorun/client/HUDmain.lua#L155))

This mod is not done yet and thus is not availiable on Steam Workshop.
When i feel this mod is ready i'll publish it myself.
Please refrain to upload this mod yet. Thanks.

I made this mod because i was in need a more "pro" hud i could not find myself.

# Broken
- guessing how to render ammo/clip/alt counter
    - Due to a project development halt this now is borken (sadly) and [here's how it looked like](https://sun9-88.userapi.com/impg/eTGxVE1RnfP-g8C4OxEsOKGzp4cCKaLt0k6M8A/jqIfSXdk3gQ.jpg?size=1920x1080&quality=96&sign=412c1b727e30632e61bc272fd9f7f603&type=album)
- To use coolvetica default font you need to download and install it in system
